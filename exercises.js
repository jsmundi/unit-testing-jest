 * Exercise 2 - Higher Order Functions
 *
 * Let's get some practice with JavaScript functions by implementing some variants
 * of the higher-order functions.
 *
 * Note: JavaScript (since its fifth edition) has built-in map, filter, and reduce functions.
 * This is great because it means you can use them in the other exercises and all your subsequent homeworks!
 * However, I have disabled them for this exercise, so you do have to write the functions yourself =)
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 */

/*
 * First, let's implement map. Map takes in
 * two arguments - an array to perform the mapping on, and the mapping function.
 * It applies the mapping function to all elements in the array and returns an array of results.
 */
var map = function (array, mappingFunction) {

    const resultArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        resultArray.push(mappingFunction(array[i], i, array));
    }
    return resultArray;
};

/*
 * Next, let's implement filter. Filter takes in
 * two arguments - an array to filter, and a filtering function. It returns a list of all
 * elements of the array such that filterFunction(element) === true.
 */
var filter = function (array, filterFunction) {

    const resultArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (filterFunction(array[i], i, array)) {
            resultArray.push(array[i]);
        }
    }
    return resultArray;
};

/*
 * Next up is reduce (AKA fold). Reduce takes in
 * three arguments - an array to reduce, a reduction function, and a seed value. For every element
 * in the array, the reduction function is applied to the _current_ aggregate value and the element
 * to obtain the _new_ aggregate value. The seed value is thus the _first_ aggregate value, and the
 * result of reduce is the _final_ aggregate value obtained after processing the last element.
 */
var reduce = function (array, reductionFunction, seedValue) {

    let accumulator;

    if (Array.isArray(array)) {

        if (seedValue) {
            accumulator = seedValue;
        } else {
            accumulator = 0;
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            accumulator = reductionFunction(accumulator, array[i]);

        return accumulator;

            accumulator = reductionFunction(accumulator, array[key], key);
        }
        return accumulator;
    }

};

/* Finally, let's write reduceRight. As you may have guessed, reduceRight is exactly like reduce,
 * except that instead of processing the elements in order (left-to-right), it processes them in
 * reverse order (right-to-left).
 */
var reduceRight = function (array, reductionFunction, seedValue) {

    const revArray = array.reverse();
    let accumulator;

    if (Array.isArray(array)) {

        if (seedValue) {
            accumulator = seedValue;
        } else {
            accumulator = 0;
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < revArray.length; i++) {
            accumulator = reductionFunction(accumulator, revArray[i]);
        }
        return accumulator;
    } else {

        if (seedValue) {
            accumulator = seedValue;
        } else {
            accumulator = "";

        for (let key in revArray) {
            accumulator = reductionFunction(accumulator, revArray[key], key);

        return accumulator;
    }

/*
 * ==========================================================================
 * Exercise 3 - Stringifying Objects
 *
 * For our final exercise, we're going to write a handy function that turns an input value into a
 * string. Specifically, this function will take a 'plain object' - one that has no function
 * properties - and turns it into a string like the one you'd see if you used console.log().
 *
 * There is a built-in way to do this in JavaScript; namely, JSON.stringify. However, we're going
 * to use a slightly different set of rules for our function, so you can't just call this method - sorry!
 *
 * Specifically, you should follow these rules to make a stringify your object:
 *
 * 1. NUMBERS and BOOLEANS are turned into strings directly (e.g. 2.5 -> 2.5, true -> true).
 * 2. STRINGS, as values, should have _single_ quotes around them. Don't worry about escaping
 *    characters like \n, \r, ', et cetera.
 * 3. An ARRAY should be stringified as a left square bracket ('['), followed by its stringified values separated
 *    by commas, followed by a right square bracket (']'). There should be a space following every comma, and there
 *    should be no comma following the final value.
 * 4. An OBJECT should be stringified as a left curly brace ('{'), followed by each of its key value pairs, followed
 *    by a right curly brace ('}'). A key-value pair should be stringified as the key (with no surrounding quotes),
 *    then a colon and a space, and then the stringified value. As with arrays, the key-value pairs should be
 *    separated by commas; there should be a space following every comma, and there
 *    should be no comma and space following the final value.
 * 5. NULL should be stringified as null, and UNDEFINED should be stringified as undefined (no quotes around either).
 * 6. If you ever encounter a function (as the original input value, as an array element, or as an object property),
 *    then you should throw a new Error('Illegal argument').
 *
 * HINT 1: Your function should work for ANY plain JavaScript object you pass it, including base types like
 * numbers/strings. This points towards a pretty slick recursive implementation...
 * HINT 2: Use Object.keys to get the keys of an object to iterate through.
 * HINT 3: You can use `typeof` to get the type of an object (as a string). Read the docs online
 * at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof.
 * HINT 4: typeof doesn't work for Arrays (it just gives you 'object'). Use Array.isArray to differentiate them.
 *
